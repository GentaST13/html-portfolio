<h1>The Best Movies According to Genta Sukmadali T.</h1>

<h2>Top 3 Movies that i've watched</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Godfather</h3>

<p>“The Godfather” is told entirely within a closed world.<br />
    That’s why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil.</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>

<p>It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison,<br />
    but "The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family.</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>

<p>"Fight Club" is the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since "Death Wish,"<br />
    a celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to drink, smoke, screw and beat one another up.</p>
